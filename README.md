## Capstone Overview

This report provides a market analysis on 10 U.S. universities for a growing start-up to consider for expansion. Methods of analysis include a ranking and scoring model based on affordable parking supply and demand. Out of 30,000+ institutions, 103 universities were selected. This filtering criteria included if the university resided in a “college town” - one where 50% of the city population is enrolled in school and the median age is between 18-22.

Our model considers the cost to park on campus per year, number of students enrolled, and percent of off-campus students. Additionally, we collected the number of religious locations nearby, the
median income of neighboring communities, and the proximity of neighborhoods to the college campus.

The features were then scored and ranked. The sum of these rankings determined the score for the supply and demand for the market.

The results concluded the best market for our client to enter were: UT Austin (1), UC
Berkeley (2), Arizona State University (3), Colorado State Fort Collins (4), University of
Michigan: Ann Arbor (5), University of Minnesota: Twin Cities (6), University of Arizona
(7), University of Utah (8), Texas A&M University (9), and Texas Tech: Lubbock (10).
